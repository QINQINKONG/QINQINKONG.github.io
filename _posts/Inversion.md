There are several types of inversions in the atmosphere:

- Radiation inversion
It generally happens during night with clear sky and calm wind. Ground cools quickly due to radiation cooling and also cools the air near the ground which causes the inversion

- Subsidence inversion

- Frontal inversion
Happens on the cold side of a surface front.

- Boundary layer inversion
Developed at the top of mixed layer, a few tens of meters to several kilometers deep

- Marine layer inversion
happens when warm, subsiding continetal air overruns cool, humid air formed from contact with cold ocean surface. Frequently occurred over California coast where the marine layer push inland and hemmed in by mountains. This strong inversion can trap pollutants in a shallow layer near ground level.
