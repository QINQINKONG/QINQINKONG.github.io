- ozone layer in the stratosphere is why we have the locally maximum temperature in stratosphere (temperature decrease with height in troposphere, increase in stratosphere and decrease again in mesosphere). 

- But, why increase again in thermosphere? I guess it's because the main energy source for this layer is from solar radiation rather than the infrared radiation and heat flux from below. Not sure about that!
