- The definition of temperature

Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules within a substance (translational motion for gas molecules and chaotic vibrations of the molecules about some mean position for solid or liquid). Since kinetic energy is not only about speed, but also determined by mass (1/2 mv^2), so for any given temperature, light molecules will have a higher average speed than heavy molecules.

- Temperature difference determines where heat flow

Heat always flow from high temperature to low temperature by several ways: conduction, convection, radiation, evaporation.

- Temperature is vastly different from our feeling of hot and cold

First, people's hot or cold feeling should be essentially determined how quick we are losing or gaining heat. Hence, not only temperature, but also humidity, wind speed, and radiation determines people's feeling. Meanwhile, even without considering these effects, people's feeling about hot or cold is not solely a function of temperature. For example, we will feel much colder if we touch a cold metal than a cold wood even they have the same temperature. That's because we lose heat faster by touching metal.
